APOCALYPTIC SURVIVAL GUIDE!

Determines the best geographic location in NYC to go to in case of one of many disasters - hurricanes, alien attacks, etc. It uses data such as proximity to shelters, supermarkets, parks, mass transit, police stations, as well as some other stuff in case of "special" disasters (ex: in case aliens/inter-dimensional creatures attack one should steer clear of public libraries and monuments/sight-seeing places). Will use API's from google, government, twitter, and NYC sites, and will try to also use google maps to display results.

Instructions are laid out on the website, but basically click on an apocalyptic scenario and get all the tips you might need from the Tools tab on the top far right.
Or, input your address and see what's around you in terms of what to stay near or stay away from.
