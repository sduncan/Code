------ HOW TO COMPILE ------
Just use make! It should work after that.

------ HOW TO RUN ------
You're going to need three terminal windows/tabs open. In one, you're going to be running the server so all you have to do is type "./serv" into the terminal and run it. In the other two terminals, you're going to be the clients chatting, so type ./client followed by the server's IP and an IP you want to connect to. For example, we typed: ./client 127.0.0.1 149.80.0.101
