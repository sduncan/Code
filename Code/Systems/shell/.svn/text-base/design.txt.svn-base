DN SHELL
by Sarah Duncan and Helen Nie (DuncaNie)

Features:
	Successfully forks and executes commands
	Parses multiple commands on one line
	Redirects properly
	Provides entertainment (at least to the creators) with various shell puns

Attempted:
	Piping does not work
	Cannot get exit or cd to work (although we know we cannot use exec for these things)
	
Bugs:
	Nothing other than failed attempts already listed (at least that we know of)
