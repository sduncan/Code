	I’ve always loved baseball. I’m terrible at it. Well, not as bad as I am at soccer, but that’s not a very high standard. I just love watching what I consider to be such a beautiful game. I’m sure part of this is all the wonderful memories I have associated with watching baseball games. 	When I lived in Buffalo, I was an acolyte (altar-server, whatever you want to call it) for my dad’s church. All the acolytes were kids of all ages but I had a group of friends, three brothers, their cousin, and their best friend, who I acolyted with regularly. Every year, as a thank you to all of us, the church would take us and our families to a minor league baseball game sometime over the summer. It was always a Friday so that we could see fireworks after the game. We would always start by sitting with our families but by the end, my friends and I were clumped together, feet up on the empty seats in front of us, cheering and yelling nonstop. Then the fireworks would go off at the end and we all just sat back, quiet as we could be, taking in the bright lights.
	One year, our seats were behind 3rd base and fly balls kept coming into our section. Not the fly balls that pop up and are easy to catch, though. These were line drives that just happened to go too wide. One such ball came straight towards me. I was six or so at the time, so I just froze. My dad stuck his hand out in front of my face at the last second and the ball bounced off of his palm. It must have really hurt, because the stadium’s medical team came over and my dad had to ice his hand and everything. We got to keep the baseball though! My dad gave it to me and I still have it. Since that day I’ve moved twice but I always make sure I keep the baseball with me. I’m probably even going to take it to college with me and keep it in my dorm. It reminds me that my parents will do anything to protect me.
	The most important part of going to see baseball games to me is that every time I go, I’m with people I really care about, whether it’s one of my close friends, my family, or my boyfriend. I love watching baseball in general, yes, but sitting in the hard stadium seats with a hot dog in hand, someone I really care about beside me, and cheering on my team, I can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else.
	There is more to it though. There’s a connection to my roots whenever I watch baseball, a game born from the same blue collar roots as my family. My great-grandfather worked on oil rigs, my grandpa was a Marine fighter pilot in World War II. I’m proud of that. I can trace my lineage back to pre-American Revolution. My family lived in Nevada for a few years, where we wore cowboy boots, Stetsons, and went to the annual (and national) Cowboy Poetry Festival. The mentality was: You are American -- be a cowboy. I’m a hardcore American (not a political statement -- just a cultural one) and watching baseball with my favorite people is what I do to remember that.
