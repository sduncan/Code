	I love music. It ebbs and flows in my head, never stopping. I have a constant symphony, wailing guitar, twinkling piano that I’m listening to. I can hear it, can’t you?
	The only person I know who can say yes, yes I can, is my sister. She is my other half. We play lacrosse together and she understands music the way I do. We even have the same sense of humor and occasionally say the exact same thing at the exact same time. But that’s where the similarities end. She’s an artist, plain and simple. She can learn anything on the guitar, for starters. She sits down, but only looks up a tab if it’s complicated. Otherwise, she has it figure out in five minutes by ear. Mhm, that kind of artist.
	She also paints. Thanks to her, our room is half painted normally and half her just doing her thing with a brush. It adds a unique part to our room that could never be replicated because it’s her putting herself into the work and onto the wall.
	Then there’s the writing. My god, she can write for hours. Not even can, but does. She’ll just sit down with her current journal and a fountain pen and write. One time, someone who didn’t know her very well asked her if she just came up with the stuff or if she consciously had to think about it to come up with something to write about. Short answer: yeah, it just comes to her. She once heard a song lyric that goes “He’s the only one who knows the words” and she took that and wrote this amazing poem that expresses such heartbreak and loss. I wish I could do that.
	Besides just being an amazing artist and person, she’s the best sister a girl could have. We stay up until all hours of the morning when we can, just talking and watching bad TV together. We really don’t need anything else. She knows what’s running through my head at all times. She’s incredibly complicated, but I know every last thing about her. Or at least, I like to think I do. We used to have to share a room when we lived in our Manhattan apartment. Now, in our Brooklyn house, we have the third floor to ourselves. It wasn’t even a question, we decided to share all the rooms. We sleep and hang out in one, have another as a guest room (that doubles as Anne’s art room), a study, a bathroom, and a room dedicated to clothing. (A girl has to look good, right? Also makes it easier for her to steal my clothes.)
	Now, I’m going off to college and I really don’t know what I’m going to do. Any randomly assigned roommate will never be able to fill the space of my current one. I love her to pieces <3
